# Libraries 📚

The libraries used and their purposes in this analysis are as follows:

1.tidyr -  to tidy up the dataset<br/> 
2.ggplot2 - for making plots i.e: barplot<br/>
3.sentimentr - to extract a sentinment value from text data<br/> 
4.readxl - to read excel data<br/> 
5.tidytext - to convert text to and from tidy formats<br/> 
6.textdata - to downoald, parse and store text datasets<br/> 
7. dplyr - to manipulate data <br/> 
8.stringr - to manipulate string datasets<br/> 
9.reshape2 - to transform our data to another structure <br/> 
10.worldcloud - to analyze and visualize keywords as a word cloud<br/> 
11.shiny - to build interactive web applications <br/> 
12.DT - to render data ojects in R as HTML JavaScript library<br/> 


# Data Dictionary 📖
1. Company: The company that the complaint was about.
2: Product: The fiancial product taht was being complained about.
4. Issue: The issue that the complain was on.
5. State: The state the complaint was from.
5. Submitted.via: The medium that the complaint was handled through
6. Company.response.to.consumer: The way in which the issue was handled
7. Timely.response: Whether or not the response was given in time
8. Complaint.ID: The Identification number for the complaint.
9. Total Sentiment: aggregate sentiment value


# Data Format 💾
1. Converting .csv to .rds
 The first step in this anlysis was converting the .csv(comma-separated values) data into .rds(R Data Serialization) for better efficiency.
```
df0<-read.csv("Consumer_Complaints.csv")
saveRDS(df0,"Consumer_Complaints.rds")
df<-readRDS("Consumer_Complaints.rds")
```
# Data Cleaning 🧹

1. Selecting the columns I needed 
The data set had a number of columns that provided information on the date, location and medium the complaint was reeived. My hypothesis was that there would be a trend in complaints  financial product. Therefore, I selected to use columns that had information the compnay being complained about, The issue being complained about and the location.
```
variables <- df%>%
  select(Company, Product,Issue,State)

```


2. Working with 50,000 rows
Since I was working with a large data set, I initially worked with the 50,000 rows for faster analysis and debugging.
```
variables[1:50000, ]
```



4. getting rid of stop words
I used
```
anti_join(stop_words) %>%
```
to get rid of words that don't have sentiment which condensed the data that I had to maniuplate.

# Data Analysis 📊
Before making any charts, I analyzed the data by the issue and groouped it by product. This allowed me get an assigned sentiment value for each financial product using the issue being complained about.
```
get_sentiments("afinn")
get_sentiments("bing")
get_sentiments("nrc")

```
```
df_2<-variables%>%
  group_by(Product)%>%
  mutate(linenumber=row_number())%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  unnest_tokens(word, Issue)
```


* Chart 1: Sentiment Analysis by Product
```
cleaned <- df_2 %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(Product, index = linenumber %/% 80, sentiment) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>% 
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

df_3 <- cleaned %>% group_by(Product) %>% 
  summarise(Total_sentiment=sum(sentiment),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  as.data.frame()
```
Then I used ggplot to create the chart.
```
ggplot(data=df_3,aes(Total_sentiment,Product))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",aes(color=Product))+
  labs( title = "Products by sentiments",x="Sentiment value", y="Product")+
  scale_color_manual(values=c('Red','Orange','Green','Yellow', 'Violet','Black','Brown','Pink','Purple','Grey'))

```

    - Debt collection has the highest volume. This tells shows most of the complaints are about Debt collection.</br>
    - Debt collection had the lowest sentiment Value. This analysis shows that the most negative sentiment was about Debt colection in particular.</br>

* Chart 2: Word Cloud
```
get_sentiments("nrc") %>% 
  filter(sentiment %in% c("positive", "negative")) %>% 
  count(sentiment)

get_sentiments("bing") %>% 
  count(sentiment)

bing_word_counts <- df_2 %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()

bing_word_counts %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(word) %>%
  with(wordcloud(word, n, max.words = 500))
```
